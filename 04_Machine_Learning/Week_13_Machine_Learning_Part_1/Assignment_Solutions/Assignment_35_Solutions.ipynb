    "a) **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**\n",
    "   * **Definition:** Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It involves developing algorithms and systems that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and solving problems.\n",
    "   * **Example:** Chatbots are a common example of AI. These are computer programs that use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to human language. For instance, virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa are powered by AI, allowing them to answer questions, set reminders, and interact with users in a human-like way.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) **Machine Learning (ML):**\n",
    "   * **Definition:** Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms learn from data and improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.\n",
    "   * **Example:** Email spam filters are a classic example of machine learning. These filters learn from examples of spam and non-spam emails provided by users. Over time, they adapt and improve their ability to distinguish between spam and legitimate emails, effectively reducing the amount of unwanted emails in your inbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) **Deep Learning:**\n",
    "   * **Definition:** Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks). These networks are designed to automatically learn and extract hierarchical features from data. Deep learning has been particularly successful in tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n",
    "   * **Example:** Image recognition in self-driving cars is a deep learning application. Deep neural networks can analyze visual data from cameras mounted on cars to identify objects like pedestrians, other vehicles, and road signs. For instance, they can detect stop signs and traffic lights, allowing the vehicle to respond accordingly."
